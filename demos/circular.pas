program Circular;
{ Simple program that demonstrates circular unit references via
  a USES clause in the implementation section.

  Note that it is NOT possible for the two units to "USE" each
  other in their interface sections. It is possible for AA's
  interface to use BB, and BB's implementation to use AA, but
  this is tricky and depends on compilation order. We don't
  document or recommend it.
